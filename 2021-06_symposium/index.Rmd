# iNZight

* Graphical user interface (GUI) for data visualisation/analysis with R
* Democratisation of data
* Novices **and** researchers with little time/skill/money
* Rapid research development (graphics, summaries, models, R code)


# Surveys

* Require user to know and specify design
* Graphs/summaries/analyses need to account for survey design/weights

* Many important survey datasets (some in the IDI)
    * Te Kupenga
    * ...
* Easy for novice users to make mistakes, get wrong results


# iNZight meets Surveys

* survey specification file
```
data = 'path/to/data.csv'
ids = clus1 + clus2
strata = strat
weights = wt
```
* Importing spec automatically loads data & sets up design info
* Immediately start making graphs/summaries/analyses
