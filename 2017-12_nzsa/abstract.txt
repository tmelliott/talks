An estimated time of arrival (ETA) that increases is inherantly bad:
your bus is 5 minutes away, and then two minutes later, its 6 minutes away!
The main reason for this is that traffic conditions between you and the bus
aren't being taken into account by the current system.
I'm developing a predictive framework that models buses 
(implemented using a particle filter) 
to estimate their speed along roads within the network, 
which is in turn used to update the road network state (travel times along roads). 
ETAs can then be based on near-real-time traffic
conditions as estimated by recent buses traveling along the same roads.
