One of the leading causes of delays in public transport systems is congestion,
which can make traffic flows volatile and difficult to predict.
In this talk, 
I will briefly explain how real-time transit vehicle observations are used 
to estimate current travel times along roads in the network,
and go on to discuss how we use this _real-time network state_
to obtain distributions for the arrival times of buses at stops
which account for uncertainties in bus location, 
traffic flows, and other sources.
Lastly, it is important to realise that the intended audience
have limited understanding of probability,
so we need to summarise the distribution in a way that is
both informative and reliable to the general public.
